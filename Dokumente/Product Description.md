    - Fast switching between Spaces.
    - Saving and restoring workspace configurations.

**E. Core Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language:** Rust
- **UI Toolkit:** GTK4 (with gtk4-rs bindings)
- **Display Server Protocol:** Wayland
- **IPC:** D-Bus
- **KI Protocol:** Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**III. Architectural Overview**

NovaDE employs a layered architecture:

1. **Core Layer:** Fundamental data types, utilities, configuration management, logging, error handling.
2. **Domain Layer:** Core application logic for theming, workspaces, user services (KI, notifications), and window management policies.
3. **System Layer:** Implementation of system-level functions (Wayland, D-Bus, etc.) and adaptation of Domain Layer logic.
4. **UI Layer:** The graphical user interface (GTK4).

This layered design promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability.
